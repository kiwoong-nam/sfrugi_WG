 A study on copy number variations with intact open reading frames using individually assembled genomes

The scripts used in this study are grouped into the following directories, reflecting the original working environments:

Assembling:
 For the generation of individually assembled genomes.

RefSeq:
  Treatment of RefSeq data
  
GENE_ANNOTATIONS:
 Gene annotation for each genome assembly.

SNV:
 Identification of single nucleotide variations.

CNV_Gene:
 Identification of iORF-CNVs.

Ver7:
 Comparison of read depths between iORF-CNVs and other genes.

ABUNDANCE:
 Calculation of the abundance of iORF-CNVs and SNVs.

POSITION:
 Analysis of the genomic positions of iORF-CNV genes.

TRANSPOSITION:
 Testing retrotransposition as a potential origin of iORF-CNVs.

MALADAPTATION:
 Investigation of selective forces acting on iORF-CNV copies.

TRANSCRIPTION:
 Analysis of transcriptional mechanisms of iORF-CNVs.

SYNTHENY:
 Testing the conservation of synteny in potential iORF-CNVs.
